                <h1>Mobile Safety</h1>
                <p>1. Keep your mobile phone device with you. Do not leave it anywhere.<br>

                    2. Read the manufacturer's instructions carefully and follow "HOW TO SET" instructions for your
                    phone.<br>

                    3. Write the 15 digit IMEI no. at a diary. In case your mobile phone is lost, this IMEI no will be
                    asked at
                    police station and will be needed to track the phone.<br>
                    4. Activate automatic keypad locking system on your mobile which can be unlocked using password.
                    This way
                    unnecessary key pressings can be avoided.<br>

                    6. If you have lost your mobile phone, lodge complaint at your nearest police station.<br>

                    7. Use mobile tracking feature to find your lost mobile set. You need to set 2 mobile no. also. In
                    this
                    feature - whenever someone inserts the new SIM card to your lost mobile set, this feature will send
                    SMS to
                    those mobile nos.<br>

                    8. Close the applications (camera, audio/video player) and connections (bluetooth, infrared, wi-fi)
                    when you
                    don't need them.<br>

                    9. When you sell your mobile set to somebody, ensure to erase all your personal records.<br>

                    10. Keep regular back-up of your mobile set.</p>
